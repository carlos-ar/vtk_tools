# Time-depend VTK writers

Just need a VTK time dependent writer.  This repository contains testing of two python based packages to help facilitate this process.

## Meshio

Most recent addition to this end.

## Pyevtk

First tried to do time dependent pyevtk, and it was pretty easy, installation and usage.

On mac, I did have an issue with my anaconda version and `pip` utilization (installed it somewhere we cannot find the module), so my lab mate ended up recommending using this conda distribution

- Link accessed 5/20/2020 and installed, but with the second command on conda forge, instead of the regular conda forge 
  - https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyevtk 
  - `conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf202003 pyevtk`
